# The Code

## Description

This is a theme for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) where I tried to use a terminal-like style. The style was inspired by projects like [Glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow) - a TUI Markdown file viewer, and [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) - a TUI text editor.

The theme is in a *very early* stage of development, most elements haven't been modified yet as finding inspiration for them is quite challenging. Currently, the theme requires a monospace font and a font size of 24 pixels. For now, most values are hardcoded.

Important note: I don't plan to make the theme perfectly aligned to the monospace font grid - if you need that, you're better off using Neovim or other similar programs.

## Installation

Currently, The Code isn't available in the Obsidian.md theme repository. You can install the theme manually by downloading `manifest.json` and `style.css` from the [latest releases](https://github.com/boreymarf/the-code-obsidian-theme/releases/latest) and placing them in a new folder in your Obsidian themes directory at `path_to_your_vault/.obsidian/themes/`.
